# IndexBuilder
To automate portfolios building based on different factors.

Currently only composed of one function to build a portfolio giving amounts of shares to purchase of each selected stock based on the given principal, for the portfolio to be balanced based on selected stock market capitalizations.

Personally used to simulate up to 85% of the S&P/TSX Capped Financials Index (Stocks representing the Top 85% Capped Weights of the index).
Function only usable on TSX, and TSX-V tickers.

Planned ahead is to create a function for US tickers, and possibly a function for having both possible markets.
May also have different options added outside of Capped Indices to simulate (yield, %yield, P/E, etc...).

Future code, and functions created will be used for Random Portfolio creation in parts of Index-vs-Equity-Risk-Analysis project (found at https://github.com/dpeslherbe/Index-vs-Equity-Risk-Analysis).
